         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Seven remarkable Judgements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>'TIs obÅ¿erv'd by PhyÅ¿icians, that every Country extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily liable to a DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e, doth likewiÅ¿e yield Å¿ome particular Herb or Remedy againÅ¿t that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿temper. In this Age, abounding with Fools that Å¿ay, not onely in their hearts, but with their blaÅ¿phemous lips, <hi>That there is no God,</hi> wherein Å¿o many poÅ¿itively deny an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Providence, and almoÅ¿t all live as if they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it, it hath pleaÅ¿ed the Divine MajeÅ¿ty to manifeÅ¿t his power by more frequent and immediate Examples amongÅ¿t us: For (as the Royal PÅ¿almiÅ¿t Å¿aith) <hi>The Lord is known by his judgements that he executeth,</hi> PÅ¿al. 9.16. Of which late dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful InÅ¿tances I have thought it a Å¿eaÅ¿onable Å¿ervice to make this Collection, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of Å¿uch as have been moÅ¿t notorious and remarkable; not doubting but many more might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if MiniÅ¿ters and others would but be at the pains to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve and communicate them, than which I know not any work can be more neceÅ¿Å¿ary and uÅ¿eful in a profane and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Generation.</p>
            <p>I Å¿hall begin with a woman at <hi>Atherbury</hi> in <hi>OxfordÅ¿hire;</hi> who keeping a Å¿mall Ale-houÅ¿e, had too much addicted her Å¿elf to lewd Speeches, Å¿ometimes Oaths, and frequently CurÅ¿es, as well on her Å¿elf as others. It happened about the beginning of <hi>May</hi> this preÅ¿ent year 1677, being all-alone in her houÅ¿e, a Neighbour-woman came thither for Å¿ome Å¿trong drink, which Å¿he having drawn and received Twelve pence or Å¿ome Å¿uch piece of money, inÅ¿tead of juÅ¿tly returning the full Change,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153904:3"/>Å¿topt and abated Two pence or Three pence out of it, beÅ¿ides what the preÅ¿ent drink came to, pretending there was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿o much owing to her; which the other reÅ¿olutely denying, the HoÅ¿teÅ¿s began to Å¿wear, and uÅ¿e Å¿everal abominable WiÅ¿hes, Å¿aying, <hi>God damn me, and the Devil burn me, if it be not Å¿o;</hi> which laÅ¿t words Å¿he often repeated: However, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident perhaps in the certainty of her knowledge to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Å¿till perÅ¿iÅ¿ting to deny it, and refuÅ¿ing to be gone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reÅ¿t of her money, the Ale-wife at laÅ¿t violently thruÅ¿t her out of her houÅ¿e, and to prevent her coming in again, Å¿hut the door and lockt it againÅ¿t her. Thus with many horrid Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ExpreÅ¿Å¿ions (if not down-right Perjuries) this poor wretch made Å¿hift to wrangle her Neighbour out of this inconÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Å¿um, but paid lamentably dear for the Å¿ame: For behold! by a Å¿tupendious and terrible Jubgement from Heaven, as we cannot but Å¿uppoÅ¿e, Å¿he was immediately call'd to an Account, and Burnt to death, as Å¿he had fooliÅ¿hly and wickedly wiÅ¿ht, in a wonderful and unheard-of manner. For having Å¿o Å¿hut and lockt the door, the Å¿ame was not opened, nor any further news heard of her, till Å¿everal hours after, her Husband chanc'd to come home, and wondring to finde his door faÅ¿t Å¿hut in the middle of the day, without being able to make any body an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer within, after much inquiry forced open the door, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with one or two of his Neighbours, their eyes encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred one of the moÅ¿t Å¿ad and diÅ¿mal Spectacles that ever Mortal beheld: for in the midÅ¿t of the floot lay the Reliques of his Wife; one Å¿ide of her Body, and the Cloaths thereupon, from the Å¿oal of her foot to the crown of her head, being ConÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and Burnt to AÅ¿hes, and nothing left but the Skeleton or Bones; whereas the other Å¿ide remained whole, and the Cloaths thereon not Å¿o much as touch'd or Å¿indg'd, though it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erv'd, that the fleÅ¿h and skin there was all turn'd black, as if it had been blaÅ¿ted with Lightning; but no viÅ¿ible fire neer her, nor indeed had there been any in the houÅ¿e that day. <hi>ConÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, all you that forget God,</hi> PÅ¿al. 50.22. and remember that to the wicked, <hi>Our God is a conÅ¿uming fire.</hi>

            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:153904:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> The next Judgement is yet more aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing, happening on the perÅ¿on of one <hi>John Duncalfe,</hi> born in the PariÅ¿h of <hi>CodÅ¿ole</hi> neer <hi>Wolver-hampton,</hi> but lately living in the PariÅ¿h of <hi>Kings-Swinford</hi> in the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> by Trade bred up a Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, but of late leading an idle pilfering kind of life; So that in <hi>March</hi> this preÅ¿ent year 1677, he did Å¿teal a Bible from one Goodwife <hi>Bays,</hi> and Å¿old it to one <hi>Norton</hi> of <hi>Wombern,</hi> and being queÅ¿tion'd for it, he poÅ¿itively denied it, and wiÅ¿ht <hi>He might Rot alive, and his hands Rot off,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if he had meddled with it:</hi> But there is a God that recompenceth the ungodly, and that Å¿ometimes according to their own wicked WiÅ¿hes: For as Å¿oon as he had Å¿old this Bible, he was taken with a Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling as it were an Ague, and immediately his Hands began to Rot, and then he look'd on it as the hand of God for his Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Imprecations. The remarkableneÅ¿s of his PuniÅ¿hment drew many from all parts to behold him; and being poor and unable, by reaÅ¿on of this rotting of his hands, to do any work, and yet Å¿eeming otherwiÅ¿e in health and very good Å¿tomach, he was laid in a Barn, a Tender appointed to look after him, and Victuals provided for him. On <hi>April</hi> 26, being viÅ¿ited by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ter of that County, he obÅ¿erv'd his Condition to be thus: One hand Å¿o rotted off that it hung onely by the MuÅ¿cles, no skin nor fleÅ¿h on the wriÅ¿t for four inches, the whole hand drawn up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; Å¿o that both for figure and colour it reÅ¿embled a BeaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof, which did all Å¿oon after drop off: and Å¿o he continu'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uming by degrees till the middle of <hi>June;</hi> at which time he had neither Hand nor Leg, but all rotted and dropt off from his wriÅ¿ts and knees, through which the bones appeared, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿s'd with corrupt and ulcerous fleÅ¿h fill'd with Maggots; and to prevent flye-blowing, uÅ¿ually cover'd with Dock-leaves. The firÅ¿t Hand and his two Legs were buried <hi>May</hi> the 13th, and five days afterwards the other Hand came off. During all this time he could Eat, Drink, and Sleep, and as far as could be perceived had none or very little pain. At firÅ¿t he deÅ¿ired people to pray for him, but afterwards became more Å¿urly and moroÅ¿e, refuÅ¿ing to diÅ¿courÅ¿e with MiniÅ¿ters or other godly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153904:4"/>ViÅ¿itants; and not Å¿hewing that Repentance as all good men hoped Å¿o terrible a ViÅ¿itation might have wrought in him: But rotting on thus by degrees, about the later end of <hi>June</hi> he gave up the GhoÅ¿t. A Spectacle Å¿o Å¿ad, that we may apply that Saying of Holy Writ, though Å¿poken on another occaÅ¿ion; Eye hath not Å¿een, nor ear heard the like long-continuing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of Judgement, as we verily believe, in any Age.</p>
            <p>'Tis within theÅ¿e two years laÅ¿t paÅ¿t, that one that was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oner in the <hi>MarÅ¿halÅ¿eys</hi> for Debt being playing at Cards, upon Å¿ome difference about their Game, fell a Å¿wearing and curÅ¿ing in a lamentable manner; and amongÅ¿t other lewd Å¿peeches, often wiÅ¿ht he might <hi>never Å¿tir more</hi> if it were not as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: when behold! Å¿carce were the words out of his mouth, but he falls down dead in the place without Å¿peaking a word, or Å¿tirring either hand or foot. Which Example we the rather preÅ¿s to your conÅ¿ideration, becauÅ¿e many men that would be thought Å¿ober, and of good converÅ¿ation, have got an ill habit of Å¿aying <hi>Ne'r Å¿tir,</hi> on every trivial occaÅ¿ion; which we hope this Å¿ad InÅ¿tance will warn them to leave off: Nor are thoÅ¿e leÅ¿s to be blam'd who hope to eÅ¿cape the puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Swearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by mincing their Oaths, as <hi>I'gad, <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>dds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>budd,</hi> &amp;c. which indeed are no leÅ¿s than Å¿wearing by the Holy Name, and pretious Blood of God: And therefore <hi>be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, God will not be mocked,</hi> Gal. 6.7.</p>
            <p>In the month of <hi>October</hi> in the year 1675, a woman living neer <hi>Well-cloÅ¿e,</hi> and not far from <hi>EaÅ¿t-Å¿mithfield<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               </hi> having wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a woman of Two-Å¿hillings, by taking the Å¿ame away from a little childe to whom it was given to play with, being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged therewith before the JuÅ¿tice, fell down upon her knees, wiÅ¿ht that <hi>God would Damn her, and the Dveil forthwith take poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of her,</hi> and many other the like vile Imprecations, if Å¿he had the Money; yet in truth, as Å¿he afterwards confeÅ¿s'd, had pilfer'd the Å¿ame: And Divine JuÅ¿tice dealt with her accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her WiÅ¿h, by giving permiÅ¿Å¿ion to the Devil; who Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly thereupon (as Å¿he related, and moÅ¿t that Å¿aw her believe) really poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿t her, and would Å¿everal times have choak'd her;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153904:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>inÅ¿omuch that coming on the Lords day into a publick Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, not far from the place aforeÅ¿aid, Å¿he was before them all lifted up above the ground, &amp; exceedingly tormented, with prodigious Å¿welling in her throat and danger of being choak'd, and then Å¿he would deÅ¿ire them to pray for her, and Å¿eem to Å¿trive with the Devil in a Å¿trange Agony, crying out, <hi>Be gone, be gone, Satan! I will Å¿erve God, I will Å¿erve God,</hi> &amp;c. But at laÅ¿t, as the MiniÅ¿ter was in his Prayer, was lifted up by inviÅ¿ible means, and flung down headlong to the ground, whence Å¿he was taken up dead. The truth hereof is Å¿ufficiently known to hundreds about this City, who with Terrour were Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es.</p>
            <p>'Tis not four years Å¿ince a woman neer <hi>Exeter</hi> being great with Childe, and having uÅ¿ed her Å¿elf to a wicked cuÅ¿tome of Å¿aying, when any thing was denied or queÅ¿tioned, <hi>Let me never be delivered,</hi> or <hi>Let me periÅ¿h with what I go with if it be not Å¿o:</hi> When her pains come upon her at the Expiration of her Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, though there appeared no natural Impediments, but rather all the Å¿ignes of a happy Chide-birth, yet could Å¿he not by any Art be delivered; but after much languiÅ¿hing Torture both Å¿he and her unborn Infant periÅ¿hed according to her WiÅ¿hes.</p>
            <p>Though divers years Å¿ince, yet 'tis Å¿till within the memory of man, and can be atteÅ¿ted by Å¿everal Å¿till living, how a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman living at St. <hi>Edmunds</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> being an UÅ¿urer and great OppreÅ¿Å¿or and Grinder of the Poor, under pretence of kindneÅ¿s, the better to colour his Ill deÅ¿ignes, was frequently wont to wiÅ¿h that he <hi>might Rot, if he wrong'd them:</hi> But God made him an Example of Vengeance: For in his later years he periÅ¿hed away in a Å¿trange manner, perfect Chalk-Å¿tones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generated in and dropping out of the Calves of his Legs; of which at length he miÅ¿erably died.</p>
            <p>I Å¿hall conclude with a remarkable Speech and ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion of a PerÅ¿on of Quality, who was hang'd the 20th of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1615, on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> for being AcceÅ¿Å¿ary to the horrid Murther of the Ingenious Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury.</hi> This Gentleman in an excellent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153904:5"/>and penitent Speech made immediately before his Death upon the Ladder, has this paÅ¿Å¿age <hi>verbatim,</hi> taken out of the exact Copy then printed, <hi>p.</hi> 153. <hi>Viz.</hi>
               <q>I had almoÅ¿t forgotten to Å¿hew you a Å¿trange thing which God brought to my memory the laÅ¿t night, which was this: I confeÅ¿s I have been a great GameÅ¿ter, and eÅ¿pecially on the other Å¿ide have waÅ¿ted and plaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Å¿ums of money, which exhauÅ¿ted a great part of my Means; which I perceiving, vowed Å¿periouÅ¿ly (not Å¿lightly or unadviÅ¿edly) to the Lord in my Vow and Prayers, <hi>Lord, let me be hang'd, if ever I play any more:</hi> Which not long after is moÅ¿t juÅ¿tly come upon me, whereof you are all Eye-witneÅ¿Å¿es, becauÅ¿e a thouÅ¿and times Å¿ince I have broken this my Vow.</q>
